Below is a complete set of materials for your 2-minute vision pitch video in English. The script is timed to fit approximately 2 minutes (about 280 words, spoken at a natural pace of 140-150 words per minute). It covers the required elements: team/idea intro, problem statement, target users, and concise idea definition.

For the video, record yourself speaking the script with energy and confidence. Use simple visuals (e.g., via PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva) as described below. Practice multiple times to ensure smooth delivery—focus on enthusiasm to convey the project's vibe.

### Pitch Script (English, ~2 Minutes)

[0:00 - 0:20: Slide 1 - Intro]  
"Hello, I'm [Your Name], founder of Apix, leading a team of seasoned blockchain developers with experience building production tools on Ethereum and Solana. We're passionate about revolutionizing the API economy on Avalanche."
